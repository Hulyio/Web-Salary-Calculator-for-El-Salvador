# Web Salary Calculator
This project is a web application designed to calculate an employee’s salary before and after mandatory deductions. It takes the base salary as input and applies deductions such as AFP, ISSS, and Renta to determine the net salary.

The system is built with Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The project follows an MVC structure with clear separation of concerns:

- Models handle the salary calculation logic.
- Controllers process input and connect models with views.
- Routes manage the application’s endpoints.
- Views display the results in a user-friendly interface.
